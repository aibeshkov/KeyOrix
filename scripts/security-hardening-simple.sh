🔒 Security Hardening Summary
=============================

✅ SSL/TLS certificates generated and configured
✅ Security headers policy created
✅ Rate limiting configuration established
✅ Security scanning tools implemented
✅ Compliance checklist documented
✅ Security monitoring configured
✅ Incident response procedures defined

📁 Security Files Created:
├── security/ssl/cert.pem (SSL certificate)
├── security/ssl/key.pem (SSL private key)
├── security/policies/security-headers.conf
├── security/policies/rate-limiting.conf
├── security/policies/monitoring.conf
├── security/compliance/security-checklist.md
└── scripts/security-scan.sh

🔧 Next Steps:
1. Configure your web server with security headers
2. Implement rate limiting in your application
3. Set up security monitoring alerts
4. Schedule regular security scans
5. Review and update security policies

🚨 Important Notes:
- SSL certificates are self-signed for development
- Use proper CA-signed certificates for production
- Regularly update security configurations
- Monitor security logs and alerts
- Conduct periodic security assessments

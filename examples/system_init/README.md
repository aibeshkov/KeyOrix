# System Initialization Example

This example demonstrates the complete system initialization and validation process for Secretly.

## What This Example Shows

1. **System Validation** - How to validate an existing Secretly setup
2. **File Structure** - What files should exist after initialization
3. **Available Commands** - All system and encryption management commands
4. **Configuration Structure** - Overview of configuration sections
5. **Security Recommendations** - Best practices for secure deployment

## Running the Example

```bash
# From the project root directory
go run examples/system_init/main.go
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, you should have initialized your Secretly system:

```bash
# Initialize the system first

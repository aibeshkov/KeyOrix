# Secret Sharing Feature Summary

## Overview

We have created a comprehensive specification for implementing Secure Secret Sharing in the Secretly application. This feature will allow users to securely share secrets with other users or groups while maintaining strong security controls and auditability.

## Completed Artifacts

1. **Requirements Document**: Defines the user stories and acceptance criteria for the Secret Sharing feature
2. **Design Document**: Outlines the technical approach, including data models, API endpoints, and security considerations
3. **Implementation Tasks**: Breaks down the work needed to implement the feature

## Key Features

1. **User-to-User Sharing**: Share secrets directly with specific users
2. **Group Sharing**: Share secrets with groups of users
3. **Granular Permissions**: Control read-only vs. read-write access
4. **Secure Encryption**: End-to-end encryption maintained during sharing
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all sharing activities
6. **User Interface**: Clear indicators for shared secrets and permissions

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will:

1. Extend the database schema with new tables and relationships
2. Add new models and methods to the core service
3. Implement secure encryption for shared secrets
4. Add HTTP and gRPC endpoints for sharing operations
5. Create CLI commands for managing shares
6. Update the user interface to support sharing

## Next Steps

To begin implementing this feature:

1. Start with Task 1: Set up database schema for secret sharing
2. Implement the core data models and storage interface extensions
3. Add the core service methods for sharing
4. Implement the encryption support for shared secrets
5. Add the API endpoints and CLI commands
6. Complete the remaining tasks in order

## Security Considerations

Special attention should be paid to:

1. Ensuring proper encryption of shared secrets
2. Enforcing permission boundaries
3. Maintaining a complete audit trail
4. Handling revocation securely
5. Preventing unauthorized access

## Conclusion

The Secret Sharing feature will be a valuable addition to the Secretly application, enabling collaborative use of secrets while maintaining security. This feature will bring us significantly closer to completing the MVP by addressing a fundamental need for collaborative secret management.

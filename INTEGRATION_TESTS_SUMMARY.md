## Test Execution

### Automated Test Runner

A comprehensive test runner script (`scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`) has been created that:

- ✅ Runs all integration test suites
- ✅ Generates coverage reports
- ✅ Performs benchmark testing
- ✅ Creates HTML coverage reports
- ✅ Provides detailed test summaries
- ✅ Validates coverage thresholds
- ✅ Generates timestamped reports

### Usage

```bash
# Run all integration tests
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
go test -v ./internal/core -run TestSharingIntegration
go test -v ./server/http -run TestSharingHTTPIntegration
go test -v ./server/grpc -run TestSharingGRPCIntegration
go test -v ./internal/cli/share -run TestSharingCLIIntegration
go test -v ./test/integration -run TestSharingIntegrationSuite

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./test/integration
```

# Self-Removal from Sharing - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the self-removal functionality that allows users to remove themselves from secrets that have been shared with them, providing users with control over their access to shared resources.

## âœ… Task 14 Completed: Implement Self-Removal from Sharing

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Core Service Method
```go
func (c *SecretlyCore) RemoveSelfFromShare(ctx context.Context, secretID, userID uint) error
```

**Functionality:**
- Validates input parameters (secretID and userID)
- Finds the user's share record for the specified secret
- Verifies the secret exists for audit logging
- Logs the self-removal action for audit trail
- Deletes the share record from storage
- Only allows removal of direct user shares (not group shares)

**Security Features:**
- Users can only remove themselves (not other users)
- Group shares cannot be self-removed (users must be removed from the group)
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Full audit trail of self-removal actions

#### 2. Audit Logging Enhancement

**New Audit Event Type:**
```go
ShareAuditEventSelfRemoved ShareAuditEvent = "share_self_removed"
```

**Audit Method:**
```go
func (c *SecretlyCore) LogSelfRemovalFromShare(ctx context.Context, auditCtx *ShareAuditContext)
```

**Audit Information Captured:**
- User who performed the self-removal
- Secret that was unshared
- Permission level that was revoked
- Timestamp of the action
- Descriptive audit message

#### 3. HTTP API Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/v1/secrets/{id}/self-share`

**Features:**
- RESTful design following API conventions
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - `204 No Content` on success
  - `404 Not Found` if share doesn't exist
  - `401 Unauthorized` if not authenticated
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for system errors

**Usage Example:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE /api/v1/secrets/123/self-share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

#### 4. gRPC Service Method

**Method:** `RemoveSelfFromShare`

**Request Structure:**
```go
type RemoveSelfFromShareRequest struct {
    SecretID uint32 `json:"secret_id"`
}
```

**Features:**
- Consistent with other gRPC service methods
- Proper authentication and permission checks
- Comprehensive error handling with gRPC status codes
- Logging for monitoring and debugging

#### 5. CLI Command

**Command:** `secretly share self-remove <secret-id>`

**Features:**
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Clear help text and usage instructions
- Proper error messages and success feedback
- Integration with existing CLI framework

**Usage Example:**
```bash
secretly share self-remove 123
```

#### 6. Internationalization Support

**New i18n Strings Added:**
- `CLISelfRemoveShort`: Short description for CLI command
- `CLISelfRemoveLong`: Detailed description for CLI command
- `ErrorSelfRemovalFailed`: Error message for failed self-removal
- `SuccessSelfRemoved`: Success message with secret ID
- `ErrorShareNotFound`: Error when share doesn't exist

**Multi-language Support:**
- English translations provided
- Framework ready for additional language support
- Consistent with existing i18n patterns

#### 7. Comprehensive Testing

**Test Coverage:**
- `TestRemoveSelfFromShare_Success`: Happy path testing
- `TestRemoveSelfFromShare_ShareNotFound`: Share not found scenarios
- `TestRemoveSelfFromShare_ValidationErrors`: Input validation
- `TestRemoveSelfFromShare_AuditLogging`: Audit trail verification

**Test Scenarios:**
- Successful self-removal
- Share not found (user not in share list)
- Group shares (should not be removable)
- Invalid input parameters
- Audit event verification
- Mock storage integration

#### 8. Error Handling and Validation

**Input Validation:**
- Secret ID must be provided and non-zero
- User ID must be provided and non-zero
- Share must exist for the user
- Share must be a direct user share (not group share)

**Error Messages:**
- Clear, user-friendly error messages
- Internationalized error text
- Proper error codes and HTTP status codes
- Detailed logging for debugging

#### 9. Integration Points

**Storage Layer:**
- Uses existing `ListSharesBySecret` method
- Uses existing `DeleteShareRecord` method
- Uses existing `GetSecret` method for validation
- Uses existing `LogAuditEvent` method

**Authentication:**
- Integrates with existing authentication middleware
- Uses user context from HTTP/gRPC requests
- Proper permission checks

**API Layer:**
- Consistent with existing API patterns
- Proper request/response handling
- Standard error response format

### 10. Security Considerations

**Access Control:**
- Users can only remove themselves from shares
- Cannot remove other users from shares
- Cannot remove group shares (must be done through group management)
- Proper authentication required

**Audit Trail:**
- All self-removal actions are logged
- Includes user ID, secret ID, and permission level
- Timestamped audit entries
- Searchable audit logs

**Data Integrity:**
- Transactional operations where possible
- Proper error handling and rollback
- Validation of all inputs
- Graceful handling of edge cases

### Usage Examples

#### HTTP API
```bash
# Remove yourself from a shared secret
curl -X DELETE /api/v1/secrets/123/self-share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

#### CLI
```bash
# Remove yourself from a shared secret
secretly share self-remove 123
```

#### gRPC
```go
// Remove self from share
req := &RemoveSelfFromShareRequest{
    SecretID: 123,
}
_, err := client.RemoveSelfFromShare(ctx, req)
```

### Benefits

1. **User Autonomy**: Users have control over their access to shared secrets
2. **Privacy**: Users can remove themselves without involving the secret owner
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all self-removal actions
4. **Security**: Proper validation and access controls
5. **Consistency**: Follows established patterns in the codebase
6. **Usability**: Available through multiple interfaces (HTTP, gRPC, CLI)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Self-Removal**: Remove from multiple secrets at once
2. **Notification System**: Notify secret owners when users remove themselves
3. **Confirmation Prompts**: Optional confirmation for CLI operations
4. **Undo Functionality**: Temporary ability to restore self-removed access
5. **Analytics**: Track self-removal patterns and statistics

This implementation provides a complete self-removal feature that enhances user control and privacy while maintaining security and audit requirements.

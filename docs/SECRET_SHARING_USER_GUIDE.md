- Update metadata or tags
- Share the secret with others
- Delete the secret

#### Write Permission
**What recipients can do:**
- Everything from read permission
- Update the secret value
- Modify metadata and tags
- Create new versions of the secret

**What recipients cannot do:**

  secretly secret share --id $secret_id --recipient john.doe --permission read
done
```

## Managing Permissions

### Viewing Current Shares

#### List Shares for a Secret
```bash
# CLI
secretly secret shares --id 123

# API
curl -X GET "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/secrets/123/shares" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

#### List All Your Shares
```bash
# CLI
secretly shares list

# API
curl -X GET "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/shares" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Updating Permissions

#### Upgrade Permission (Read â†’ Write)
```bash
# CLI
secretly shares update --id 456 --permission write

# API
curl -X PUT "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/shares/456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"permission": "write"}'
```

#### Downgrade Permission (Write â†’ Read)
```bash
# CLI
secretly shares update --id 456 --permission read
```

### Revoking Access

#### Remove Specific User Access
```bash
# CLI
secretly shares revoke --id 456

curl -X DELETE "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/shares/456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

#### Remove All Shares for a Secret
```bash
# Get all shares for the secret
secretly secret shares --id 123 --format json | \
  jq -r '.shares[].id' | \
  xargs -I {} secretly shares revoke --id {}
```

## Group Sharing

### Understanding Groups
Groups allow you to share secrets with multiple users at once. When you share with a group:
- All current group members gain access immediately
- New group members automatically gain access
- Removed group members automatically lose access
- Permission level applies to all group members

### Sharing with Groups

#### Via Web Interface
1. Click "Share" on your secret
2. Select "Group" as recipient type
3. Choose the group from the dropdown
4. Set the permission level
5. Confirm the share

#### Via CLI
```bash
# Share with a group
secretly secret share --id 123 --group developers --permission read
```

#### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/secrets/123/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_id": 10,
    "is_group": true,
    "permission": "read"
  }'
```

### Managing Group Shares

#### List Group Shares
```bash
# CLI - filter for group shares only
secretly shares list --groups-only

# API - filter response for group shares
curl -X GET "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/shares?recipient_type=group" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

#### Update Group Permissions
```bash
# Update permission for entire group
secretly shares update --id 456 --permission write
```

### Group Membership Changes

When group membership changes:
- **User Added**: Automatically gains access to all secrets shared with the group
- **User Removed**: Automatically loses access to all group-shared secrets
- **Group Deleted**: All shares with that group are automatically revoked

## Accessing Shared Secrets

### Finding Shared Secrets

#### Web Interface
- Shared secrets appear in your main secrets list
- Look for the sharing indicator (ðŸ‘¥ icon)
- Use the "Shared with me" filter to see only shared secrets
- Owner information is displayed for each shared secret

#### CLI Interface
```bash
# List all secrets shared with you
secretly shared-secrets list

# Filter by permission level
secretly shared-secrets list --permission write

# Filter by owner
secretly shared-secrets list --owner admin
```

### Working with Shared Secrets

#### Viewing Shared Secret Details
```bash
# Get secret information
secretly secret get --id 123

# View secret value (if you have read permission)
secretly secret value --id 123

# View secret versions
secretly secret versions --id 123
```

#### Modifying Shared Secrets (Write Permission Required)
```bash
# Update secret value
secretly secret update --id 123 --value "new-secret-value"

# Update metadata
secretly secret update --id 123 --metadata key=value

# Add tags
secretly secret update --id 123 --tags production,database
```

### Understanding Sharing Context

When viewing a shared secret, you'll see:
- **Owner Information**: Who owns the secret
- **Your Permission Level**: What you can do with the secret
- **Share Date**: When it was shared with you
- **Last Modified**: When the secret was last updated
- **Version History**: All versions (if you have read access)

## Self-Management

### Removing Yourself from Shares

Sometimes you may want to remove yourself from a shared secret:

#### Via Web Interface
1. Navigate to the shared secret
2. Click "Remove Access" or "Leave Share"
3. Confirm the action

#### Via CLI
```bash
# Remove yourself from a specific secret
secretly secret self-remove --id 123
```

#### Via API
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.secretly.com/api/v1/secrets/123/self-share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Managing Your Shared Secrets View

#### Organizing Shared Secrets
- **Filter by Owner**: See secrets from specific users
- **Filter by Permission**: Show only read or write access secrets
- **Sort by Date**: Order by when secrets were shared with you
- **Search**: Find specific shared secrets by name or content

#### Notifications
Configure notifications for:
- New secrets shared with you
- Permission changes on shared secrets
- Secrets being unshared from you
- Updates to shared secrets you're watching

## Security Best Practices

### For Secret Owners

#### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant the minimum permission level required
- Regularly review and audit who has access
- Remove access when no longer needed

#### 2. Regular Access Reviews
```bash
# Monthly review of all your shares
secretly shares list --format table

# Check specific high-value secrets
secretly secret shares --id 123
```

#### 3. Monitor Access Patterns
- Review audit logs regularly
- Watch for unusual access patterns
- Set up alerts for sensitive secrets

#### 4. Use Groups Wisely
- Share with groups rather than individual users when possible
- Keep group membership up to date
- Use descriptive group names

### For Recipients

#### 1. Respect Access Levels
- Don't attempt to exceed your permission level
- Report any access issues to the secret owner
- Use shared secrets responsibly

#### 2. Secure Your Account
- Use strong authentication
- Keep your credentials secure
- Report suspicious activity immediately

#### 3. Clean Up Access
- Remove yourself from shares you no longer need
- Notify owners if you no longer require access
- Keep your profile information current

### General Security

#### 1. Audit Trail Monitoring
```bash
# View recent sharing activities
secretly audit logs --type sharing --recent

# Check access to specific secrets
secretly audit logs --secret-id 123
```

#### 2. Encryption Verification
- All shared secrets maintain end-to-end encryption
- Keys are never shared in plaintext
- Revoked users cannot decrypt previously shared secrets

#### 3. Network Security
- Always use HTTPS for web access
- Use secure networks when accessing shared secrets
- Consider VPN for sensitive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission Denied" Errors
**Problem**: Cannot access a shared secret
**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have the correct permission level
2. Check if the share has been revoked
3. Confirm the secret still exists
4. Contact the secret owner

#### "Share Already Exists" Errors
**Problem**: Cannot create a share that already exists
**Solutions**:
1. Check existing shares for the secret
2. Update the existing share instead of creating new one
3. Verify recipient information is correct

#### "User Not Found" Errors
**Problem**: Cannot share with specified user
**Solutions**:
1. Verify the username is correct
2. Check if the user account is active
3. Ensure the user has access to the system
4. Try using user ID instead of username

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading of Shared Secrets
**Solutions**:
1. Use pagination for large lists
2. Apply filters to reduce result sets
3. Check network connectivity
4. Clear browser cache (web interface)

#### API Rate Limiting
**Problem**: Too many requests error
**Solutions**:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Reduce request frequency
3. Use batch operations when available
4. Contact support for rate limit increases
